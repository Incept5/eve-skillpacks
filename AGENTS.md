# Eve Skillpacks - Agent Instructions

## CRITICAL: Load Eve Docs + CLI First

Before any work in this repo, load the Eve docs skill and review CLI guidance:

```bash
skill read eve-read-eve-docs
cat eve-work/eve-read-eve-docs/references/cli.md
```

This keeps skill updates aligned with current CLI behavior and manifests.
