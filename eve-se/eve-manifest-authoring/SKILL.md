# Eve Manifest Authoring

Keep the manifest as the single source of truth for build and deploy behavior.

## Minimal skeleton (v2)

```yaml
schema: eve/compose/v2
project: my-project

registry:
  host: ghcr.io
  namespace: myorg
  auth:
    username_secret: GHCR_USERNAME
    token_secret: GHCR_TOKEN
services:
  api:
    build:
      context: ./apps/api           # Build context directory
      dockerfile: Dockerfile        # Optional, defaults to context/Dockerfile
    image: ghcr.io/myorg/my-api     # Target image (no tag needed - managed by Eve)
    ports: [3000]
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
    x-eve:
      ingress:
        public: true
        port: 3000

environments:
  staging:
    pipeline: deploy
    pipeline_inputs:
      some_key: default_value

pipelines:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - name: build
        action:
          type: build               # Builds all services with build: config
      - name: release
        depends_on: [build]
        action:
          type: release
      - name: deploy
        depends_on: [release]
        action:
          type: deploy
```

## OCI Image Labels (GHCR Auto-Linking)

GHCR requires packages to be linked to a repository for proper permission inheritance. Add these labels to your Dockerfiles to enable automatic linking:

```dockerfile
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source="https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO"
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.description="Service description"
```

**Why this matters**: Without this label, GHCR creates "orphaned" packages that only org admins can push to. The Eve builder injects this label automatically at build time, but including it in your Dockerfile is recommended as defense-in-depth.

For multi-stage Dockerfiles, add the labels to the **final** stage (the production image).

## Registry Modes

```yaml
registry: "eve"     # Eve-native registry (internal JWT auth)
registry: "none"    # Disable registry handling (public images)
registry:           # BYO registry (full object — see skeleton above)
  host: ghcr.io
  namespace: myorg
  auth: { username_secret: GHCR_USERNAME, token_secret: GHCR_TOKEN }
```

## Managed Databases

Declare platform-provisioned databases with `x-eve.role: managed_db`:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    x-eve:
      role: managed_db
      managed:
        class: db.p1
        engine: postgres
        engine_version: "16"
```

Not deployed to K8s — provisioned by the orchestrator on first deploy.
Reference managed values elsewhere: `${managed.db.url}`.

## Legacy manifests

If the repo still uses `components:` from older manifests, migrate to `services:`
and add `schema: eve/compose/v2`. Keep ports and env keys the same.

## Services

- Provide `image` and optionally `build` (context and dockerfile).
- Use `ports`, `environment`, `healthcheck`, `depends_on` as needed.
- Use `x-eve.external: true` and `x-eve.connection_url` for externally hosted services.
- Use `x-eve.role: job` for one-off services (migrations, seeds).

### Build configuration

Services with Docker images should define their build configuration:

```yaml
services:
  api:
    build:
      context: ./apps/api           # Build context directory
      dockerfile: Dockerfile        # Optional, defaults to context/Dockerfile
    image: ghcr.io/org/my-api       # Target image (no tag needed - managed by Eve)
    ports: [3000]
```

Note: Every deploy pipeline should include a `build` step before `release`. The build step creates tracked BuildSpec/BuildRun records and produces image digests that releases use for deterministic deployments.

## Local dev alignment

- Keep service names and ports aligned with Docker Compose.
- Prefer `${secret.KEY}` and use `.eve/dev-secrets.yaml` for local values.

## Environments, pipelines, workflows

- Link each environment to a pipeline via `environments.<env>.pipeline`.
- When `pipeline` is set, `eve env deploy <env>` triggers that pipeline instead of direct deploy.
- Use `environments.<env>.pipeline_inputs` to provide default inputs for pipeline runs.
- Override inputs at runtime with `eve env deploy <env> --ref <sha> --inputs '{"key":"value"}' --repo-dir ./my-app`.
- Use `--direct` flag to bypass pipeline and do direct deploy: `eve env deploy <env> --ref <sha> --direct --repo-dir ./my-app`.
- Pipeline steps can be `action`, `script`, or `agent`.
- Use `action.type: create-pr` for PR automation when configured.
- Workflows live under `workflows` and are invoked via CLI; `db_access` is honored.

## Platform-Injected Environment Variables

Eve automatically injects these into all deployed service containers:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `EVE_API_URL` | Internal cluster URL for server-to-server calls |
| `EVE_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Public ingress URL for browser-facing apps |
| `EVE_PROJECT_ID` | The project ID |
| `EVE_ORG_ID` | The organization ID |
| `EVE_ENV_NAME` | The environment name |

Use `EVE_API_URL` for backend calls from your container. Use `EVE_PUBLIC_API_URL` for
browser/client-side code. Services can override these in their `environment` section.

## Interpolation and secrets

- Env interpolation: `${ENV_NAME}`, `${PROJECT_ID}`, `${ORG_ID}`, `${ORG_SLUG}`, `${COMPONENT_NAME}`.
- Secret interpolation: `${secret.KEY}` pulls from Eve secrets or `.eve/dev-secrets.yaml`.
- Managed DB interpolation: `${managed.<service>.<field>}` resolves at deploy time.
- Use `.eve/dev-secrets.yaml` for local overrides; set real secrets via the API for production.

## Eve extensions

- Top-level defaults via `x-eve.defaults` (env, harness, harness_profile, harness_options, hints, git, workspace).
- Top-level agent policy via `x-eve.agents` (profiles, councils, availability rules).
- Agent packs via `x-eve.packs` with optional `x-eve.install_agents` defaults.
- Agent config paths via `x-eve.agents.config_path` and `x-eve.agents.teams_path`.
- Chat routing config via `x-eve.chat.config_path`.
- Service extensions under `x-eve` (ingress, role, api specs, worker pools).
- API specs: `x-eve.api_spec` or `x-eve.api_specs` (spec URL relative to service by default).

Example:

```yaml
x-eve:
  agents:
    version: 1
    config_path: agents/agents.yaml
    teams_path: agents/teams.yaml
  chat:
    config_path: agents/chat.yaml
  install_agents: [claude-code, codex]
  packs:
    - source: ./skillpacks/my-pack
```
