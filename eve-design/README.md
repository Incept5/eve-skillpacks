# Eve Design

Architecture and design thinking for building on Eve Horizon.

## Skills Included

- **eve-agent-native-design** — Design principles: parity, granularity, composability, emergent capability
- **eve-fullstack-app-design** — Architect a full-stack app on Eve: manifest, services, DB, pipelines, deploys, secrets, observability
- **eve-agentic-app-design** — Layer agentic capabilities onto a full-stack app: agents, teams, inference, memory, events, chat, coordination

### Design Progression

The three skills form a deliberate progression:

1. **Principles** (`eve-agent-native-design`) — How to think about agent-native design
2. **Foundation** (`eve-fullstack-app-design`) — How to architect the PaaS layer
3. **Agentic Layer** (`eve-agentic-app-design`) — How to add agents on top of that foundation

Each layer assumes the previous. Start with principles, establish the foundation, then layer agents.

## Who Should Use This

Anyone designing applications, APIs, or agent systems on Eve Horizon. Load these skills when making architectural decisions, designing new features, or evaluating whether your app is truly agent-native.
