# Chat Gateway

## Overview

The Gateway service normalizes external chat events into Eve events using a pluggable provider architecture. Providers implement the `GatewayProvider` interface and register via factories at startup. Two transport models exist: webhook (HTTP push) and subscription (persistent connection).

## Transport Models

| Model | Mechanism | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Webhook** | Platform sends HTTP POST to Eve endpoint | Slack |
| **Subscription** | Eve connects to external relay and listens | Nostr |

## Provider Interface

Every provider implements the `GatewayProvider` contract:

| Member | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `name` | Unique provider identifier (e.g., `slack`, `nostr`) |
| `transport` | `'webhook'` or `'subscription'` |
| `capabilities` | Feature flags: threads, reactions, file uploads |
| `initialize(config)` | Lifecycle hook: setup connections, load state |
| `shutdown()` | Lifecycle hook: close connections, flush state |

### Webhook-Specific Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `validateWebhook(req)` | Verify request authenticity (signatures, challenge handling) |
| `parseWebhook(req)` | Parse payload into: `message`, `handshake`, or `ignored` |

### Shared Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `sendMessage(target, content)` | Deliver outbound message to provider-specific target |
| `resolveIdentity(externalUserId, accountId)` | Map external user to Eve identity |

## Provider Lifecycle

1. Factories register at startup in `app.module.ts`.
2. Instances are created per integration (one per org integration).
3. `initialize(config)` is called to set up the provider (load secrets, open connections).
4. Provider processes events for the lifetime of the integration.
5. `shutdown()` is called on teardown (close sockets, flush state).

Subscription providers start persistent connections on `initialize()` and tear them down on `shutdown()`. Webhook providers are stateless between requests.

## WebhookController Dispatch

```
POST /gateway/providers/:provider/webhook
```

1. Controller extracts `:provider` from path parameter.
2. Looks up initialized provider instance in the registry.
3. Calls `validateWebhook(req)` -- reject on failure, respond to handshake challenges.
4. Calls `parseWebhook(req)` -- returns `message`, `handshake`, or `ignored`.
5. For `message` results, routes the normalized event through the agent resolution pipeline.

## Slack Provider (Webhook)

### Endpoints

- **Generic**: `POST /gateway/providers/slack/webhook`
- **Legacy**: `POST /integrations/slack/events` (preserved for existing installations)

### Signature Validation

Slack requests are validated using the signing secret (`EVE_SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`). The provider computes `HMAC-SHA256(signing_secret, v0:timestamp:body)` and compares against the `X-Slack-Signature` header. Invalid signatures are rejected before parsing.

### Event Parsing Flow

1. Event arrives at webhook endpoint.
2. Signature validated with signing secret.
3. Integration resolved: `team_id -> org_id`.
4. Event type determines dispatch path:

### Message vs app_mention Events

| Event Type | Trigger | Dispatch Path |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| `app_mention` | User writes `@eve ...` | Parsed as `@eve <agent-slug> <command>`, routed to specific agent |
| `message` | Any message in subscribed channel (no mention) | Dispatched to channel/thread listeners only |

For `app_mention`:
- First word after `@eve` is tested as agent slug.
- If it matches a known slug, route directly to that agent's project.
- If no match, route to org `default_agent_slug` with full text as command.
- Agent slug resolves to `{project_id, agent_id}` (unique per org).
- Job created for the agent; thread + event recorded.

For `message` (no mention):
- Only dispatched if channel/thread has active listeners.
- Each listener agent receives a separate job in its own project.

### Listener Mechanics

```
@eve agents listen <agent-slug>     # channel-level or thread-level
@eve agents unlisten <agent-slug>   # remove listener
@eve agents listening               # show active listeners
@eve agents list                    # directory of slugs
```

#### Thread-Scoped vs Channel-Scoped

- Command issued in a **channel**: creates a channel-level listener. All `message` events in that channel are dispatched.
- Command issued inside a **thread**: creates a thread-level listener. Only messages within that specific thread are dispatched.
- Multiple agents can listen to the same channel or thread.
- Listener subscriptions stored in `thread_subscriptions` with `subscriber_type: agent`.

### Outbound

Responses delivered via Slack Web API (`chat.postMessage`), threaded to the originating message.

## Nostr Provider (Subscription)

### Connection Model

Connect to configured relay(s) via WebSocket. Subscribe to events targeting the platform pubkey.

### Inbound Event Types

| Kind | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Kind 4 | NIP-04 Encrypted DM | Private message to platform pubkey |
| Kind 1 | Public Mention | Public note tagging platform pubkey |

### Inbound Flow

1. Relay broadcasts event matching subscription filters.
2. Provider verifies **Schnorr signature** on the event.
3. Kind 4 events are decrypted using **NIP-04** (shared secret derived from sender pubkey + platform private key).
4. Message normalized to standard inbound format.
5. Agent slug extracted from content.
6. Routed through the same chat dispatch pipeline as Slack.

### Agent Slug Extraction (Nostr)

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `/agent-slug <text>` | `/mission-control review PR` |
| `agent-slug: <text>` | `mission-control: review PR` |
| First word of public mention | `mission-control review PR` |

If no slug matches, the org default agent is used.

### Outbound Mechanics

| Context | Event Kind | Details |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| DM reply | Kind 4 | NIP-04 encrypted, published to relays |
| Public reply | Kind 1 | NIP-10 reply threading tags (`e` and `p` tags) |

### Cross-Relay Deduplication

Event IDs are tracked in a bounded set (10k entries). Duplicate events from multiple relays are dropped.

## Multi-Tenant Mapping

- `team_id -> org_id` stored at integration connect time.
- Agent slugs in `agents.yaml` are unique per org, selecting the target project/agent.

## Identity Resolution

`resolveIdentity(externalUserId, accountId)` maps an external user (Slack user ID, Nostr pubkey) to an Eve identity. External identities are stored in `external_identities` and linked to Eve users/orgs for permission checks and audit trails.

## Gateway Discovery Policy

Agents must opt in to be visible and routable from gateways. See `agents-teams.md` for full details.

| Policy | Directory | Direct chat | Internal dispatch |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| `none` | Hidden | Rejected | Works |
| `discoverable` | Visible | Rejected (hint) | Works |
| `routable` | Visible | Works | Works |

Directory endpoint: `GET /internal/orgs/{org_id}/agents` -- filters out `none` agents, supports `?client=slack`.

Slug routing: `POST /internal/orgs/{org_id}/chat/route` -- enforces `routable` policy and `gateway_clients` whitelist.

## Agent Slug Extraction (Summary)

| Provider | Pattern | Fallback |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Slack | `@eve <slug> <command>` | Org default agent |
| Nostr | `/slug <text>` or `slug: <text>` or first word | Org default agent |

## Thread Key Format

Thread continuity uses a canonical key scoped to the integration account:

```
account_id:channel[:thread_id]
```

- Slack: `T123ABC:C456DEF:1234567890.123456`
- Nostr: `<platform-pubkey>:<sender-pubkey>`

## Chat Simulation

Test the full routing pipeline without a live provider connection.

```bash
eve chat simulate --project <id> --team-id T123 --channel-id C123 --user-id U123 --text "hello" --json
```

Returns `thread_id` and `job_ids` showing the dispatch result.
